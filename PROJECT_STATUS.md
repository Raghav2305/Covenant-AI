## Project Status Summary

This document summarizes the current state of the Contract Lifecycle & Obligation AI Copilot project, outlining backend progress, deferred items, and the plan for frontend development.

### 1. Backend Status: Fully Functional (for Implemented Features)

We have successfully set up and configured the backend, ensuring all currently implemented functionalities are operational.

**Key Achievements & Functional Components:**

*   **FastAPI Application:** The core Python FastAPI application is running and accessible.
*   **MCP Database Server:** The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for database interactions is running and communicating correctly with the main application.
*   **PostgreSQL Database:** A PostgreSQL database (`contract_ai`) has been successfully created, and all necessary tables have been generated via Alembic migrations.
*   **OCR Functionality:** The `ocr_processor.py` is implemented and ready to extract text from various document types (PDFs, DOCX, images).
*   **LLM Integration:** The `llm_client.py` is configured to interact with OpenAI's API for tasks like obligation extraction, compliance analysis, and copilot responses.
*   **Simple RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** The `simple_vector_store.py` is integrated into the `contract_processor.py` for keyword-based indexing and retrieval of contract/obligation context. This enables the RAG *flow* for the copilot.
*   **Monitoring Engine:** The `monitoring_engine.py` is set up to check deadlines and generate alerts, utilizing the MCP for data.
*   **Configuration:** All environment variables (`.env`), application settings (`config.py`), and Alembic configurations (`alembic.ini`, `env.py`) have been correctly set up and debugged.

### 2. Backend Components Omitted/Deferred (as agreed):

To streamline initial development and focus on core functionalities, the following backend components have been intentionally omitted or deferred for later implementation:

*   **CRM and Real-time Finance MCP Integrations:** The server-side code for these MCP connectors (`crm_server.py`, `finance_server.py`) is not yet implemented.
*   **Celery/Redis:** Background task processing and advanced caching mechanisms are not yet configured.
*   **Authentication/Authorization:** User authentication and authorization features are not yet implemented.
*   **Full Semantic RAG:** The advanced Weaviate-based vector store (`vector_store.py`) for true semantic search is not currently in use (the `SimpleVectorStore` is used instead).

### 3. Frontend Development Plan:

The goal is to build a professional, multi-page frontend tool suitable for client showcases.

*   **Approach:** Start from scratch, replacing the existing placeholder `frontend/` directory.
*   **Technology Stack:** React.js with TypeScript and Material-UI (MUI).
*   **Core Pages/Views:** Dashboard, Contract Management, Obligation Management, AI Copilot Interface, Alerts/Notifications, Reports.
*   **Next Step:** Scaffold a new React TypeScript project using Vite.

### 4. Current Task:

*   The user is currently updating their Node.js installation to meet the prerequisites for scaffolding the new React project.
*   Once Node.js is updated, the user will manually delete the old `frontend/` directory and then run the command to scaffold the new React project.
